# AI Agent Instructions

## Overview

This library is a small Clojure wrapper over a select number of features
in [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/).

## Build System

Pantomime uses [Leiningen](https://codeberg.org/leiningen/leiningen). See `project.clj`.

### Running Tests

```shell
lein all test
```

## Comments

 * Only add very important comments, both in tests and in the implementation
 * Keep comments concise and to the point
 * Add comments above the line they are referring to, not at the end of the line (an example of what's not to do: `1 + 1. %% equals 2`)
 * Make sure to use proper English grammar, in particular articles, punctuation and full stops at the end of sentences except for Markdown list items

## Git Instructions

### General

 * Never add yourself to the list of commit co-authors
 * Never mention yourself in commit messages in any way (no "Generated by", no AI tool links, etc)

## Writing Style Guide

 * Never add full stops to Markdown list items

## After Completing a Task

### Iterative Reviews

After completing a task, perform up to twenty iterative reviews of your changes.
In every iteration, look for meaningful improvements that were missed, for gaps in test coverage, and for deviations from the instructions in this file.

If no meaningful improvements are found for three iterations in a row, report it and stop iterating.
